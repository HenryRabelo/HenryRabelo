  Hi there! Thank you for checking out my GitHub! ‚ú®

  I sometimes upload projects made to demonstrate concepts used at my job or that were made during college.

  #### Who am I?
  I work in CyberSecurity, which I find pretty neat. I've always loved puzzles, and I do see my job as a big puzzle challenge, each one with its unique quirks.

  I like researching security and privacy concepts, and what can be done to better secure a system. There is no perfectly secure system, but I strive to have a good balance between Security, Privacy & Convenience.

</p>

#### My workflow üíª
I try to harness the best of the tools in my field and I try to always be practical when it comes to my choices. I've used just about every mainstream OS, but I tend to champion Linux systems, because of their flexibility and ease of use.

I use containers that have the main tools of my workflow installed, so I can have a highly reproducible and clean work environment. Security best practices such as 2FA are a must, and compartmentalization of the tools I use further secures my environment.

#### Languages I speak:
- English
- Portuguese
- I am currently learning German! üá©üá™
  - Ich spreche nur ein bisschen jetzt, aber Ich lerne schnell! Ich finde Ich lerne gern deustch. ü§ì
