## CyberSec Admin & Tech Enthusiast

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my GitHub!

I sometimes upload projects made to demonstrate concepts used in my job or that were made during college.

#### Who am I?
I work as a CyberSecurity Administrator & Tester, which I find pretty neat. I always loved puzzles, and I see my job as a big puzzle challange, each one with its unique quirks. It's pretty exciting, really.

I really enjoy researching security and privacy concepts, and what can be done to better secure a system. I am big on system administration, since my job involves verifying everything that is wrong with someone else's system.

I see this as a triangle between Security, Privacy & Convenience, in the sense that there is no perfect combination, but you can have a well-balanced act between them.

#### My workflow
I try to harness the best of the tools in my field and I try to aways be practical when it comes to my choices. I've used just about every mainstream OS out there, but I tend to champion Linux systems, because of their flexibility and ease of use.

I use containers with the main tools of my workflow installed, so I can have a highly reproducible and clean work environment. Security best practices such as 2FA is a must, and compartmentalization of tools is also a good practice.

Here's some of the technologies used in various different assignments:
